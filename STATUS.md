## Standing orders — Tron scrap / Arena later / Books live

- **Tron chrome is scrapped.** Cyan/gold Tron-night phone redesign is not shipping. They were going for **Arena** instead. Arena is a later **named** pass. Do not implement Arena UI on this line. Do not merge [#52](https://github.com/ajt1995/reelos/pull/52) / [#70](https://github.com/ajt1995/reelos/pull/70) / [#59](https://github.com/ajt1995/reelos/pull/59) onto the 1.2.50.x repair line. Do not house Apply those tarballs.
- **1.2.51 stays parked / unused.** It was reserved for Tron. Tron chrome is **not shipping**. Do **not** silently reassign 1.2.51 to Arena, Books, or a drive-by stamp. Leave the number unused until the owner names a stamp. Future 1.2.50.x channel notes: `1.2.51 parked (was Tron chrome; scrapped — do not reuse).` Do not write `Not 1.2.51 (Tron)` as if Tron were still the next ship.
- **Books / Kavita still wanted.** Must not die with Tron. Do not glue Books to #70 as 1.2.51. Product lands on **current 1.2.50.x gold chrome** (now **1.2.50.37**). See [#74](https://github.com/ajt1995/reelos/pull/74). Salvage Books from #70 / #52 / #42 / #40 / #17 **without** Tron tokens, CSS, or magenta. Arena chrome is a separate named stamp later. **Beta channel is wired in this stamp; Arena+Books are not shipped here.**

### Books path (write it; do not code Kavita on a STATUS pass)

Land on 1.2.50.x gold. Kind is a word or a 6px pip. Download stays gold. No magenta Books app. No wait for Arena.

- Wizard **Books** chip, same pattern as Music, **off by default**. Settings intent toggle.
- Legal catalog search only (Gutenberg / Standard Ebooks / Internet Archive). Allowlist in grab/download code. No pirate indexers.
- Phone primary: download the file; the device reader opens it. No in-app EPUB player. Ready for a book is **Download**.
- Kavita (`lscr.io/linuxserver/kavita`, compose profile `books`, `/srv/media/books`, `:5000`) is the **box library**, a secondary “Library on the box” link. Caddy `/kavita*` only — do not steal `/books*`.
- Home/Library Books row only when `intent.books` **and** real files exist.
- Rebase onto current `main` (1.2.50.31+). Do not merge Tron+Books as one 1.2.51 stamp.

## Current ship

***1.2.50.37 is the ship.*** 2026-09-11. 36 stopped Sonarr ffprobe and stacked FUSE. 35 made Apply skip npm ci / vite build on 4GB. This stamp is **36 plus** the two scale/speed slices in code: detect ≤4.5Gi MemTotal (toggle cannot un-small a 4GB box); cap *arr/JF library scans; persist “don’t remount FUSE if listed”; idle high-load skips extra recover/compose/heal without fighting the D-state skip; channel tarball ships a **prebuilt** hashed UI so the house never compiles; `start:box` serves nitro static + `/api` plugins (vite preview only if nitro+api cannot bind — not `vite --host`). Does not take Tron (#52 / #70 / #59). 1.2.51 parked. **No house Apply from the agent.**

## Stamp

- **VERSION / channel:** `1.2.50.37`
- **channel tarball:** `main.tar.gz`
- **Base:** `main` at 1.2.50.36 ([#113](https://github.com/ajt1995/reelos/pull/113) ffprobe/FUSE)
- **House snapshot:** 1.2.50.31; firstboot disabled; `stack-installed` latched
- **1.2.51** remains unused/parked (was Tron; not reassigned to Arena)

## Changelog

### 4GB detect, don’t only toggle

`box_is_small()` reads MemTotal. ≤4.5Gi is small even if `performance.json` says `low: false`. Encoding, scan caps, and skip-compile all use that. Loadavg ≥2 with nothing playing skips extra recover/compose/heal. ffprobe D-state skip from 35/36 stays first.

### Cap library scans / keep MediaInfo off

`enableMediaInfo` stays false in compose configs and PUTs (36 — do not regress). `rescanAfterRefresh: Never` on *arr debrid configs. Jellyfin periodic library-scan triggers are cleared on a small/low box. Trickplay/chapter/subtitle extraction stay off. Import still scans dump folders.

### One FUSE — don’t remount if listed

Same as 36: lazy-unmount stale only. Persist `/var/lib/reelos/fuse-listed` + `fuse-policy.json` (`remountIfListed: false`) when `/mnt/debrid` lists. `nudge_fuse` / `ensure_fuse` log don’t remount if listed. Never umount `/media`.

### Prebuilt client — 4GB never compiles

`prebuilt/vercel-output` (hashed `/assets/…`, nitro server, no poster dupes) ships in `main.tar.gz`. Mailman copies it into staging and skips `vite build`. `npm ci` still only when the lockfile changed (35).

### Production API + static UI

`NODE_ENV=production npm run start:box` prefers nitro+api: hashed `/assets/styles-*.css` (not `/src/styles.css`) plus existing `/api` plugins. Leftover Vite is `vite preview` of that prebuild if nitro import fails. `vite --host` only when no prebuild exists (dev checkout).

```

## Owner / house Apply

House stays **1.2.50.31**. **Do not Apply 36.** Do not Apply from the agent. Wait until house `ffprobe` D-state is ~0, then phone **Check → Apply 1.2.50.37 once**. 37 includes 36 and 35. Do not re-enable `reelos-firstboot`. Do not delete `ota.lock`. Do not wipe `/media`.

## Do not

- Merge #52 / #70 / #59 onto the 1.2.50.x repair line
- Stamp **1.2.51** (parked; was Tron; chrome scrapped; not Arena)
- Implement Arena UI until the owner names that pass
- Glue Books/Kavita to Tron chrome or burn it as 1.2.51
- Ship Arena chrome or Books in this stamp
- Tap Apply twice
- Delete `ota.lock`
- Wipe `/media` or TorBox
- Post house Apply from the agent
- Re-enable `reelos-firstboot` or re-run house `/opt/reelos/install.sh`
- Apply 36 (37 supersedes)
